Build WME Validator
-------------------

At the moment WME Validator uses few custom build scripts:

- `release.sh` -- to produce a normal release file in `build/WME_Validator.user.js`
- `debug.sh` -- to produce a debug version (`DEBUG` is defined, simple
   optimizations) in `build/WME_Validator.debug.js`
- `gf.sh` -- to produce formatted release file for GreasyFork in  `build/WME_Validator.gf.js`

Example build run:

    $ cd validator
    $ ./10.release.sh
